OWASP Nettacker project is created to automate information gathering, vulnerability scanning and eventually generating a report for networks, including services, bugs, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other information. This software **will** utilize TCP SYN, ACK, ICMP, and many other protocols in order to detect and bypass Firewall/IDS/IPS devices. By leveraging a unique method in OWASP Nettacker for discovering protected services and devices such as SCADA. It would make a competitive edge compared to other scanner making it one of the bests.

Quick Setup & Run
============
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d && docker exec -it nettacker_nettacker_1 /bin/bash
# python nettacker.py -i owasp.org -s -m port_scan
```
* Results are accessible from your (https://localhost:5000) or https://nettacker-api.z3r0d4y.com:5000/ (pointed to your localhost)
* The local database is `.data/nettacker.db` (sqlite).
* Default results path is `.data/results`
* `docker-compose` will share your nettacker folder, so you will not lose any data after `docker-compose down`
* To see the API key in you can run `docker logs nettacker_nettacker_1`.
* More details and setup without docker https://github.com/OWASP/Nettacker/wiki/Installation
