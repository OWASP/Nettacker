# This is a sample configuration file that you can use to configure global options for your Canari project. Common use-
# cases for this configuration file include API keys, performance options, etc. Below are some sample sections with
# example option types. You can remove these sections completely with no effect.
#
# Canari's configuration parser automatically marshals option values into their appropriate types when setting or
# getting options. The following option value types are supported:
#
# List option:
# foo = ["this", "is", "a", "list"]
#
# String option:
# foo = this is a string
# foo = this\, is\, a\, comma-separated string
#
# Multiline string option:
# foo: this is a very long
#    string
#
# Interpolated string option with environment variables:
# foo = ${PATH}:/usr/local/bin
# foo = ${HOME}/mydata.txt
#
# Interpolated string option with other option variables:
# foo = %(bar)/foo
# bar = baz
#
# Integer option:
# foo = 1
#
# Float option:
# foo = 2.2
#
# Python object option (only for local transforms):
# foo = object://os.path/join
