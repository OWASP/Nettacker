Please describe your changes and let us know which OS and Python version you've tested the codes on, be sure you added code-based documentation (English only), avoid multiple commits for a feature, separate the new individual updates per commit and select an appropriated name for it. Do not send irrelevant commits per pull request and if commits are not related send a new PR. The code style must match with the PEP8 standard with 4 spaces indent, and human-readable (review the references in [clean-code](https://github.com/zdresearch/OWASP-Nettacker/issues/135) topic).
