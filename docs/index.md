## Nettacker

OWASP Nettacker is an automated penetration testing framework designed to help cyber security professionals and ethical hackers perform reconnaissance, vulnerability assessments, and network security audits efficiently. Nettacker automates information gathering, vulnerability scanning, and credential brute forcing tasks, making it a powerful tool for identifying weaknesses in networks, web applications, IoT devices and APIs.
